# Age-Based AI Risk Management Policy Framework

This repository provides a risk-aware, age-sensitive AI usage framework proposed by the Lori Framework.  
It outlines emotional and developmental risk profiles for different age groups (from early childhood to older adults) in relation to Humanize-capable AI systems.

The framework includes structured policy recommendations for schools, families, platform developers, and governments.  
It is intended to guide ethical AI design, usage restrictions, and safeguard mechanisms against overdependence and emotional substitution.
